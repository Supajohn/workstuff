<h1>A Time to Talk</h1> 
<h2>Robert Frost (1874-1963)</h2>

<p>
When a friend calls to me from the road<br>
And slows his horse to a meaning walk<br>
I don't stand still and look around<br>
On all the hills I haven't hoed,
</p>
<p>
And shout from where I am, What is it?<br>
No, not as there is a time to talk.<br>
I thrust my hoe in the mellow ground,<br>
Blade-end up and five feet tall,
</p>
<p>
And plod: i go up to the stone wall<br>
For a friendly visit.<br>
</p>
